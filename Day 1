Day 1 – GRE Preparation Log

Date: 26/10/2025
Activities Completed:

Took a full-length GRE mock test to assess my current level.

Analyzed the results thoroughly to identify weak areas and patterns in mistakes.

Found that my main weakness lies in Coordinate Geometry (Quant section).

Subscribed to GregMat Plus Plus for structured preparation and resources.

Completed Vocabulary Groups 1–5 from GregMat’s word list.

Watched GregMat’s YouTube videos to understand test strategies and verbal reasoning techniques.

Will attach the detailed mock test performance report for reference.
